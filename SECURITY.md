# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Master Chess, we take security seriously and appreciate the efforts of security researchers to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities they may find. If you believe you've discovered a security vulnerability in this project, we encourage you to notify us immediately. We will work with you to address the issue promptly and appropriately.

Please follow these guidelines to report a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly** until we have had a chance to address it.
2. **Submit your report privately** to our security team by [creating an issue](https://github.com/OOPProject-to-the-moon/2D-Chess-game-OOP-Project/issues/new?assignees=&labels=security+vulnerability&template=security-vulnerability-report.md&title=) in our GitHub repository.
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including:
    - A description of the vulnerability and the potential impact.
    - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability or a proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrating the exploitability.
    - Any additional information that may help us understand and mitigate the issue quickly.

We commit to the following actions:

- We will acknowledge your report within 72 hours and provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability.
- We will work with you to understand and validate the vulnerability.
- We will keep you informed about the progress of resolving the issue.
- Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will publicly acknowledge your contribution (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

We kindly request that you follow responsible disclosure practices and give us a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before disclosing it to others.

Thank you for helping make Master Chess a more secure project!
